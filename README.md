# password-generator

The purpose of this project was to build a password generator which allows the User to choose the length and character types included in their password. 

Utilized boolean's allowing the User to choose which characters they want included in their passwords. Chosen characters were then added from their individual array into a master array of character options.

Using the User Input, ran a for loop running through the master list of character Options and ran a math.random function to select characters at random fromn thr characterOptions array and return a password matching User's required password length.

Updated code to include conditional statements preventing invalid input and selectiong from User.
